Pastoral Chat

GOAL:
After having used IRC for many years, I let my friends talk me into
playing a couple MMORPGs. I loved the idea of being in a fantastic world to
socialize; sometimes we would connect to the server just to chat, not to play.

My goal for this software is to be a chat medium, like IRC, in a fantastic,
imaginative setting. I want people to have to travel to their destinations,
to interact with the world's wildlife, buildings, and flora.

This ends up being, basically, Second Life without a sinister economy to
disrupt such a beautiful idea.


TO USE:
- import db.sql
- run ./pastoral
- connect on port 1337
